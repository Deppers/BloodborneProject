While Rom does appear to have spider minions, she does not have physiological characteristics similar to a spider. In fact, if we are to compare her to another life form, she has physical characteristics similar to a caterpillar. Many item descriptions heavily talk about metamorphosis and evolution perhaps Rom is in the early stage of metamorphosis and has yet to achieve her final form? From the Caryll rune Clockwise Metamorphosis and the Anti-clockwise Metamorphosis: &quot;The discovery of blood made their dream of evolution a reality. Metamorphosis, and the excesses and deviation that followed. were only the beginning.&quot;"/>
