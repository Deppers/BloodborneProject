During the fog, the clone will warp around the arena (typically behind the player) in an attempt to catch the player off-guard. While the original uses a variety of leaping and long-range attacks, where her arms extend to extreme length. During this part of the fight the back of the boss is wide open, and you can deal massive damage."/>

During subsequent fog episodes both Mergo and the clone will teleport on the players right as they run counter-clockwise.
