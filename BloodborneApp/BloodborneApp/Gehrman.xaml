This seems to be more effective than hanging back since it is then harder to get in a hit and he can also stagger you with his gun even if you're not attacking.

            	<Run Text="In scythe form, a fairly easy way to deal with it is to bait out one of his attacks and walk backwards. His attack will fall short, and you have time to hit him once and repeat. For his curved sword and gun, run towards him and roll right, if he rolls and shoots you'll get two free hits on him. Then back out, because he might retaliate quickly. His long combo ends in a ground slam with his curved sword and then a shoot with his gun, if you stay close, you can roll through the gun shot and get a hit in on him. Take the fight slow, and stay close to max health, as his scythe does massive damage."/>

            	<Run Text="Gehrman can alternate between a blunderbuss and a heavy pistol. The heavy pistol takes a moment to charge before firing, and being hit by it will parry the player even if they are not performing any action when hit."/>
