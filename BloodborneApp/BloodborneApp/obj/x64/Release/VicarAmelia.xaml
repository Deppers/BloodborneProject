As the player finds her, she is seen praying to the altar in the Grand Cathedral which hold a misshapen skull, presumably that of Laurence, the founder of the Healing Church. Here she kneels awaiting her inevitable transformation, praying, clasping her pendant which existed to carry a reminder that had been all but forgotten, and that may have prevented the madness that led Yharnam to ruin before her eyes: Fear the Old Blood."/>
