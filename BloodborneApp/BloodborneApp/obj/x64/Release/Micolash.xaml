Head up the stairs here and you will find a drop down where you can drop into that dead end room."/>

            	<Run Text="When you engage the boss for the second time he will be much more aggressive, using Augur of Ebrietas, fists (very weak), and an AoE spell that is very difficult to dodge and might one shot you. The secret here is to never let him cast the AoE spell, because if he does then you are really only counting on luck to survive it. If you stand really close to him (literally touching him), he will never use that spell, resorting instead to his fists and tentacles, which allows you to simply stun him to death, while occasionally strafing to dodge his tentacles. If you get too far away and he does manage to start the spell, shoot him immediately, if you catch him early enough in the animation it will stagger him out of the casting"/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="Backstabs (charged R2 to the back) can be performed when he does the tentacle attack if you have a fast enough weapon. This is a reliable way to deal considerable damage (and even heal yourself if you have the right runes), particularly during the first half of the fight."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="Depending on your insight count, Micolash may teleport through different mirrors after teleporting at half health. After hitting Micolash several times along the chase from mirror to mirror, he will eventually run into the dead end room as usual."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="In his second location, Micolash gains the ability to use A Call Beyond to summon numerous arcane missiles and unleash them upon the hunter (also used by hostile hunter in Bergynwerth). If it hits multiple times it will kill anyone from full health (it has no trouble 1 shotting a hunter with 50 vitality and equipped with full choir set). He will sometimes spam this ability, using it again as soon as he completes channeling the first attack. Using the old hunter bone will help somewhat but other than that there is no real counter when he does this, since unlike the Augur of Ebrietas, this attack cannot be interrupted and the missiles will fire even if Micolash is staggered in the middle of this channel animation."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="If you have a high enough Arcane to use Beast Roar, hit him with as many attacks as you can. Then, once your Stamina bar is almost empty, cast beast roar. It will knock him down and give you time to either heal or get your stamina back to repeat the process. This will insure that he will never get a chance to cast his AoE again."/>
