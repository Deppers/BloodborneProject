Attacking the lower half of the body will do much less damage, unless elemental damage is used. However there seems to be a sweet-spot in its crotch that can be hit with a high swinging weapon such as transformed Ludwig's L2 or Burial Blade, will deal standard damage."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="Projectile weapons aimed at the head can deal damage to Amygdala quite reliably. The Executioner's Gloves is a great way to do this."/>

            	<Run Text="Watch out for its stomp attacks and jumping attacks. Its 3rd phase (about 30% HP) is very aggressive, and is the hardest part of this fight. During this stage, it will rip off two of her arms and swing them as weapons."/>

            	<Run Text="If you attack its arms, they will visibly bleed out. Any attack on that arm will do increased damage until it heals it, so it's more effective to focus on one, if possible. This tactic also works on its legs, though the damage before bleeding is significantly reduced."/>

            	<Run Text="An upgraded Cannon with Bone Marrow Ash is also very effective, as is the Tonitrus, and the Threaded Cane in either form. All of these are safe, simple, and fun strategies to use."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="If you're having trouble with Amygdala's third stage, get behind it and attack. It should jump, but it will jump away from you, and it should be still facing away when it lands. When this happens, dash for it and use a dashing attack on its legs or tail. It'll do small damage, but it'll be safe. Keep pursuing it and hurting it. Eventually you will tenderize its legs or tail and you can do more damage to it. It'll take a while, but it's safer than trying to attack its head and arms now--especially in the Defiled Chalice. Occasionally, it may still try to stomp, so be ready to dodge it."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="Attacking the arm closest to her legs will more often than not trigger her stomp attack, making her first two stages much easier. However this is not always the case and she may flail her arms instead, in which case dodging outward or between her legs is the safest method."/>
            	<LineBreak/>
            	<Run Text="Standing still during her third phase jump attack will always have her land a distance away from you, quickly running back to the arm closest to her leg will have her repeat this process. Through this method you can land a couple guaranteed hits from relative safety upon each landing."/>
