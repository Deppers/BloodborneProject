Dodge his Cosmic Barrage either by sprinting in a circle or hiding behind the the convenient pillar placed in the middle of the room. All his moves except for the sudden Quad Stomp, and slightly quick Penta-Rush, are heavily telegraphed and are incredibly easy to dodge. Stay behind him when possible and shave off his health."/>
