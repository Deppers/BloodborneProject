If the player backstabs him while he is charging his buff, the bullets will still work, as will melee attacks to interrupt his attacks. This makes the second half of the fight significantly easier (He will however still have the new moveset)."/>

            	<Run Text="If you lock on and stand in-front of him while staying close to him as to lure out his melee attack you can get through the entire fight without him casting his buff. The sweet spot to interrupt his attack is at the very peek of the swing just before he brings the weapon back toward you. If the player can manage to keep him attacking and hit that sweet spot followed by Visceral Attacks the boss fight can be very easy."/>

            	<Run Text="Don't be tempted to use heavier weapons. Using the short version of Ludwig's Holy Blade or the sword part of the Kirkhammer will be more useful than the trick versions. If you can land a running combo on Logarius you can interrupt his attacks."/>

            	<Run Text="When Logarius starts to fly around, keep an eye on him in the air and dodge just before he hits the ground. When he lands he is stunned for a second or so allowing you to get in and attack him again."/>
