With high agility and superhuman strength, this enemy should not be taken lightly. The Cleric Beast owes his name to a rumor according to which members of Yharnam's clergy transform into this kind of monster upon infection. Legends say that clerics turn into the most hideous beasts."/>

In other words, the captain's return, and this emblem, determined the end of the hunt&quot;. The Oedon Chapel Dweller also mentions &quot;These hunts have everyone all locked up inside. Waiting for it to end... It always does, always has, y'know. Since forever. But it won't end very nicely, not this time&quot;. This means that the Hunts are a regular occurence in the world of Bloodborne and the Captain who holds the emblem signals the end of the hunt by opening the gates of Cathedral Ward. But the current Captain didn't survive the night and ended up turning into a hideous beast called &quot;The Cleric Beast&quot;."/>
