Learn how many hits you can get in before you should dodge away. She is also less likely to charge attack if you're close enough. The belly slam attack, which is more common should you focus her chest, is a great opportunity to put some damage into her."/>

            	<Run Text="Her head is the weak point in the fight and will take the bonus damage, an effective strategy is to use the Cannon in the fight and shoot her head. Then she will drop down, allowing for a Visceral Attack. Immediately after the completion of the visceral attack you can charge up an attack with a long weapon. She will not recover from the Visceral Attack in time and the full R2 will make her available to other Visceral. Alternatively, hit her head with Burial Blade charge attack."/>

            	<Run Text="If you do not have the Cannon you can still lure some of her attacks to lower the head and have a clear attack. However, this strategy is risky because sometimes she'll do a charge attack, with terrible consequences for your HP (and is difficult to dodge properly)."/>
